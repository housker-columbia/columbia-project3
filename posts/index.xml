      <description>&amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s the bottom-line: the benefits of a shorter working week with no reduction in pay are well-evidenced: employees are happier and healthier, and the organizations they work for are often more productive, more efficient, and more easily retain team members.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Source:&#xA;https://www.forbes.com/sites/dedehenley/2023/04/30/the-surprising-benefits-of-working-four-days-a-week/?sh=775c4fd14c9f</description>
